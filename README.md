  #  Face Emotion Recognition (ResNet18 + CBAM)

A real-time Face Emotion Recognition system built using **PyTorch**, **ResNet18 + CBAM**, **MediaPipe**, and **Streamlit**.

This project detects faces using MediaPipe and predicts emotions in real-time and also image through a clean Streamlit interface.

## Model Architecture

- Backbone: ResNet18
- Attention: CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module)
- Input Shape: `1 x 3 x 224 x 224` (training input was 48x48 however we upscale the image size into 224 because pretrained resnet18 is expect this )
- Output: 7 emotion classes
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
- Optimizer: Adam

CBAM improves performance by helping the model focus on important facial regions such as eyes and mouth.

##  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NG11-git/Face-Emotion-Recoginition.git
cd Face-Emotion-Recoginition

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run Streamlit App
```
streamlit run src/app.py
```

## Real-Time Inference (Without Streamlit)
```
python src/realtime_infer.py
```
## Train the Model
```
python src/train.py
```
Recommended:
Image Size: 64x64
Grayscale input
Data augmentation (HorizontalFlip, Rotation)
--
## Model Performance
Achieved ~73% training accuracy
Performance depends on:
Dataset balance
Lighting conditions
Face crop quality
--
## Known Improvements Implemented
Fixed BGR → RGB conversion
Improved face crop quality
Webcam horizontal flip
Softmax confidence handling
Better preprocessing pipeline
